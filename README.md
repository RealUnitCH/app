# Real Unit App

A Flutter wallet for Real Unit investors. Multi-chain, BitBox-ready, KYC-aware.

> **Status:** Early development. APIs, flows and UI are still moving.

## Contributing

**New PRs may only merge into `develop` if test coverage is 100% on the activated surface.** Concretely:

- `flutter test --coverage` must report 100% lines / functions / branches on every file in the activated surface (see Coverage scope below). CI will fail the build below threshold.
- Defensive code that genuinely cannot be reached in `flutter_test` (platform channels without a test override, native plugin entry points, BLE callbacks) is exempted by an inline `// coverage:ignore-line` annotation with a one-line reason.
- The branch is protected on GitHub: a PR cannot be merged while CI is red.

**Coverage scope:** `lib/packages/**` (services, repositories, signers, utils) and the `cubits/` + `bloc/` directories under each `lib/screens/<feature>/`. Widget files (`lib/screens/<feature>/<feature>_page.dart` and `lib/widgets/**`) are exercised via `testWidgets` specs and excluded from the line-coverage gate — widget tests count as `widget` coverage in the feature matrix, not as line %. Generated files (`*.g.dart` from `build_runner` / Drift) are also stripped after the scope extract — they are tool output, not developer code, and would otherwise drag the scoped line % down for free.

The five-tier testing model (Tier 0 Cubit unit · Tier 1 FakeBitbox integration · Tier 2 firmware simulator · Tier 3 Maestro flows (handbook simulator + deferred BitBox02 hardware) · Tier 4 BLE VCR/replay stretch) is tracked in [#314](https://github.com/DFXswiss/realunit-app/issues/314). See [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) for the full tier picker. New BitBox-touching PRs are expected to add tests at the appropriate tier(s).

## Coverage infrastructure roadmap

The 100% rule above is the target state. Until the items below land, it is aspirational and not yet CI-enforced:

- [x] `flutter test --coverage` step in `.github/workflows/pull-request.yaml`
- [x] lcov filter narrowed to the activated surface (`lib/packages/**` + `lib/screens/**/cubit(s)/**` + `lib/screens/**/bloc/**`) and a per-run summary posted to the workflow step summary
- [x] lcov threshold check failing the build below a committed floor on the scope above
- [x] Floor gate lives in its own CI job (`Coverage Floor Gate`) so it is wire-up-ready as a separately required status check
- [ ] GitHub branch protection on `develop` requiring the `Coverage Floor Gate` check (ruleset `PRs` / id `11317379`)
- [ ] Build-time feature-flag mechanism (analogous to `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_*` in `dfx-wallet`) so non-MVP features can be gated out of the activated surface — required before the 100% rule is realistic across all feature areas
- [x] Inline `// coverage:ignore-*` annotations on truly unreachable paths, each with a one-line reason — applied to Drift schema getters across `lib/packages/storage/`, defensive `assert(false) → throw StateError` fallthroughs in `wallet.dart`, `BitboxCredentials` sync entry points that only exist to satisfy the web3dart interface, the platform-channel forwarders in `PathProviderAdapter` and `BiometricServiceAdapter`, and the `_localTesting` dev-only `Uri.http` branch in `api_config.dart`

**Ratchet protocol.** The committed floor lives in two flat files at the repo root: `.coverage-floor-lines` and `.coverage-floor-functions` (integer percent, no `%` suffix). CI fails the build when scoped coverage drops below either value. Raising the floor is encouraged on every PR that raises measured coverage — bump the file in the same commit and the gate moves up. Lowering the floor requires explicit reviewer sign-off; PR convention is the `coverage:lower-floor` label so the regression is visible in the PR list rather than smuggled in. The functions floor is parked at a placeholder today because `flutter test --coverage` does not emit `FN` records — the gate warns instead of failing on that metric until upstream adds support.

> **Before first use:** two PR labels are referenced by this tooling but are not auto-created. Run `gh label create tier3:full` once on the repo to enable per-PR opt-in for the Tier 3 handbook workflow — without the label the workflow's `if:` gate never matches and the job silently skips on PRs. Run `gh label create coverage:lower-floor` once to make floor-lowering PRs grep-able; the coverage floor gate itself runs unconditionally on every PR, this label is a review-convention marker only and is not read by any workflow.

Three PRs have closed the largest gaps for KYC + BitBox logic: [#319](https://github.com/DFXswiss/realunit-app/pull/319) (Tier 0 cubit tests), [#320](https://github.com/DFXswiss/realunit-app/pull/320) (Tier 1 FakeBitbox integration), [#321](https://github.com/DFXswiss/realunit-app/pull/321) (dashboard buy actions + auth service tests).

## Features

User-facing functions, their activation status, and the tests that cover them. It is the source of truth for "what does this wallet actually do" — keep it in sync when adding or removing a flow.

**Status legend:** `always` = ships on every build · `hardware` = needs a BitBox hardware wallet (see [Supported hardware wallets](#supported-hardware-wallets) below) · `planned` = surface exists but flow not yet implemented.

**Triage legend** (MVP testing decision): `mvp` = in MVP scope, must reach full test coverage before launch · `defer` = ships but does not block MVP coverage (coverage required eventually, no hard deadline) · `planned` = not in scope for MVP.

**Tests legend:** `widget` = `testWidgets` spec under `test/screens/**` · `golden` = visual-regression spec under `test/goldens/**` (pixel-exact baseline rendered on the dfx01 self-hosted runner, see [`docs/visual-regression-tests.md`](docs/visual-regression-tests.md)) · `unit` = pure-Dart `test/packages/**` spec · `cubit` = `bloc_test`-style spec for a Bloc/Cubit · `integration` = `test/integration/**` spec crossing ≥ 2 production layers with `FakeBitboxCredentials` · `e2e` = Maestro YAML flow on real hardware · `—` = no test exists.

> Per-feature line-coverage % is not surfaced in this table. The repo-wide scoped coverage is enforced by the `Coverage Floor Gate` CI job against `.coverage-floor-lines` / `.coverage-floor-functions`; the lcov artifact attached to every PR run holds the per-file breakdown.

### Supported hardware wallets

`hardware`-status flows require a BitBox device. Platform availability depends on the model:

| Device | Android | iOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BitBox 02 | yes | no |
| BitBox 02 Nova | yes | yes |

The transport is USB on Android and Bluetooth on iOS; the original BitBox 02 has no Bluetooth, so iOS support requires a BitBox 02 Nova.

## Triage gaps

The activated surface (see "Coverage scope" above) is at **100 % scoped line coverage**. Every file under `lib/packages/**`, `lib/screens/**/cubit(s)/**`, and `lib/screens/**/bloc/**` either ships with tests or carries an `// coverage:ignore-*` annotation with a documented reason. The previous bullet list of partially-covered services, KYC cubits, biometric unlock, and DFX backend services has been retired — those gaps are closed.

Out of scope of the gate and tracked elsewhere:

- **Widget render paths** — measured separately via `testWidgets` specs, not in the line-coverage gate (deliberate; see `docs/testing.md` "Tier 0" rationale).
- **Visual regression (goldens)** — every `lib/screens/**/*_page.dart` has a `test/goldens/**/*_golden_test.dart` companion, validated pixel-exact on the dfx01 self-hosted runner by the `Visual Regression` CI job. Not folded into the line-coverage gate. The one exception is `lib/screens/web_view/web_view_page.dart` — `InAppWebView` is a platform-view that has no headless render in `flutter_test`, the spec is committed with `skip: true`. See [`docs/visual-regression-tests.md`](docs/visual-regression-tests.md).
- **Tier 2 (firmware simulator)** — runs in `bitbox-simulator.yml`, not folded into the scoped coverage number.
- **Tier 3 (Maestro handbook flows)** — runs in `tier3-handbook.yaml`, not folded in.
- **`lib/widgets/chain_asset_icon.dart`** and **`lib/widgets/image_picker_sheet.dart`** — `Image.asset` / `ImagePicker` platform-channel paths, see "Surface that needs infra work" in `docs/testing.md`.

## Testing tiers

[#314](https://github.com/DFXswiss/realunit-app/issues/314) defines a 5-tier model for BitBox-touching code:

- **Tier 0 — Cubit unit tests** (`bloc_test` + `mocktail`). Fast, no platform, no BitBox. Covers every state transition.
- **Tier 1 — FakeBitbox integration tests** (`FakeBitboxCredentials` at the BitBox boundary, runs under `flutter test --coverage`). Drives multi-layer flows without hardware. Specs live under `test/integration/`.
- **Tier 2 — Firmware simulator** (TCP transport + Docker `bitbox02-firmware/simulator`). End-to-end with real crypto, no hardware. Planned.
- **Tier 3 — Maestro flows** (`.maestro/handbook/*.yaml` for software-only flows; the BitBox02-hardware variant is deferred and has no flow files committed yet). The handbook flows run on a fresh iOS Simulator, automated via [`tier3-handbook.yaml`](.github/workflows/tier3-handbook.yaml) — opt-in on PRs via the `tier3:full` label, always runs on push to `develop`. An upstream Maestro driver-hang regression on `macos-latest` runners makes intermittent first-attempt failures expected; `scripts/run-handbook-flows.sh` retries the driver-hang class up to 3× per flow (CI-hardening work originally tracked in [#487](https://github.com/DFXswiss/realunit-app/issues/487), now closed). The hardware variant remains manually triggered before each release until Phase 3 of [#314](https://github.com/DFXswiss/realunit-app/issues/314) lands.
- **Tier 4 — BLE VCR / replay** (capture on hardware once, replay deterministically). Stretch — most of its value is covered by Tier 2 + Tier 3 in tandem.

Non-BitBox code only needs Tier 0 + widget tests; Tier 1+ are reserved for hardware-coupled paths.

## Tests

| Stack    | Command                   | What it covers                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flutter  | `flutter test`            | Unit + widget specs under `test/**` (pure-Dart `test` and `testWidgets`)                                                                                                                                  |
| Coverage | `flutter test --coverage` | Writes `coverage/lcov.info`. CI narrows it to the activated surface and hard-fails when scoped coverage drops below the floor in `.coverage-floor-lines` / `.coverage-floor-functions`. See "Coverage infrastructure roadmap" above for the ratchet protocol. |
| Analyzer | `flutter analyze`         | Dart static analysis per `analysis_options.yaml`                                                                                                                                                          |

Tier 1 specs live under `test/integration/**` and run inside the same `flutter test --coverage` invocation as Tier 0 — no separate `integration_test/` harness today (that Flutter-convention directory is reserved for on-device runs that are not yet wired up). Tier 3 handbook flows (iOS Simulator) are wired via [`tier3-handbook.yaml`](.github/workflows/tier3-handbook.yaml); the BitBox02 hardware variant remains deferred.

## Release versioning

Tags follow plain SemVer: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. There is no pre-release suffix — the previous `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` schema has been retired.

| Component | When does it bump? | Workflow | Distribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PATCH` (`v1.0.X` with X >= 1) | Automatically on every push to `develop` (see `auto-tag.yaml`). | `release.yaml` (internal lane) | TestFlight + Play Internal. |
| `MINOR` (`v1.X.0`) | Manual tag push (App-Store-update marker). | `release.yaml` (production-candidate lane) | TestFlight + Play Internal. Production promotion is done manually in the store backends. |
| `MAJOR` (`vX.0.0`) | Manual tag push. | `release.yaml` (production-candidate lane) | TestFlight + Play Internal. Production promotion is done manually in the store backends. |

A single release workflow (`release.yaml`) listens on the `v*` tag pattern and uses a guard job to route based on the PATCH component: patch tags go through the internal lane (`prerelease: true` on GitHub), MAJOR/MINOR tags through the production-candidate lane (`prerelease: false`). Either way the build lands in the Test tracks first — the App Store / Play Store production track is never updated by a tag push.

The build number is derived deterministically from the tag by `tool/generate_release_info.dart` using `MAJOR * 10_000_000 + MINOR * 100_000 + PATCH * 1_000 + 999`. The fixed `+999` suffix keeps every new build strictly above the legacy beta build codes; the first new build `v1.0.15` lands at `10_015_999`, comfortably above the highest published legacy beta `v1.0.0-beta.14` at `10_000_014`.

`pubspec.yaml`'s `version:` field has two roles:

- The `+0` build-number sentinel is for local builds — CI always overrides `--build-name` / `--build-number` from the tag. Don't bump the `+N` part manually.
- The `X.Y.Z` part is a **floor** for MAJOR / MINOR jumps. Patch increments come from the latest tag; pubspec is only consulted to trigger jumps. To start a new MINOR / MAJOR train (e.g. `v1.1.0`), bump pubspec on `develop` and the next auto-tag will pick it up.

Typical patch flow: PR merges into `develop` → `auto-tag.yaml` creates `v1.0.X` → `release.yaml` (internal lane) ships the build to TestFlight + Play Internal.
