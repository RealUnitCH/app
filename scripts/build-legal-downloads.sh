# Build the downloadable PDF + DOCX of the in-app legal documents from their
# Markdown sources under assets/legal/, into <output-dir>/legal/.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-legal-downloads.sh <output-dir>
#
# Run ONLY inside the handbook image's legal-docs-builder stage (needs pandoc +
# weasyprint). The output is intentionally NON-deterministic — pandoc embeds
# timestamps and tool-version metadata — so it is treated like the assembled
# screenshots: generated only in the image, git-ignored, never committed, and
# never sync-gated. The deterministic HTML block (the download links) is the
# separate concern of scripts/assemble-handbook-legal.py.
#
# weasyprint is used as the PDF engine (HTML/CSS based) deliberately, to avoid
# pulling a full TeX Live into the image just for PDF rendering.
#
# Document discovery mirrors assemble-handbook-legal.py: the same three bases,
# languages discovered by glob (never hardcoded), so a future assets/legal/
# <base>_<lang>.md is picked up automatically.
