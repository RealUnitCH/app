# Tier-3 navigation smoke for the 26 .maestro/handbook/*.yaml flows
# (01-welcome … 26-terms). Handbook pages 276–290 (referral/promo) are
# golden-mapped in assemble-handbook-screenshots.sh and are not Maestro
# flows: the sequential onboarding chain cannot reach an eligible
# Empfehler (KYC Level 30 + 70 REALU).
#
# For each flow (alphabetical order):
#   1. run the Maestro flow — navigates the real built app to the target
#      screen and asserts the expected UI state is reachable
#   2. take a diagnostic screenshot via `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`,
#      written to build/handbook-captures/ so CI can attach it as an
#      artifact for forensic inspection on assertion failures
#
# NOT the source of `handbook.realunit.app` screenshots — those are the
# visual-regression Golden baselines under test/goldens/screens/, mapped
# by scripts/assemble-handbook-screenshots.sh. See docs/handbook/README.md.
#
# Why xcrun rather than Maestro's built-in `takeScreenshot`?
#   Maestro screenshots go through XCUITest, which renders the view-hierarchy
#   bitmap. Flutter screens that use `BackdropFilter` (e.g. SeedBlurCard on
#   the seed-backup pages) live on a GPU layer outside that bitmap and come
#   out as solid black PNGs. `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot` uses the
#   simulator's compositor and captures the actual final frame.
#
# Required:
#   * iOS Simulator booted with Runner.app installed (`flutter build ios
#     --simulator --debug` then `xcrun simctl install booted ...Runner.app`)
#   * maestro CLI on PATH (or at $HOME/.maestro/bin/maestro)
#
# Locale:
#   The booted simulator's locale is pinned to de_CH because the handbook
#   flows assert on German UI strings (e.g. "Digitale Wallet", "Erstellen
#   Sie Ihre PIN", "Einstellungen"). Local devs running this script will
#   have their simulator locale temporarily overridden; `simctl erase` on
#   the next run brings it back to defaults. CI runners default to en_US
#   without this pin and would fail the first German-string assertion.
#
# Retry strategy:
#   The Maestro version is pinned by `.maestro-version` (read by the
#   workflow's install step). Historically Maestro 2.3.x–2.5.x had
#   intermittent driver-hang AND silent-tap-loss issues on Apple
#   Silicon + iOS 26.x (see mobile-dev-inc/maestro#3137); the pin
#   targets a known-good release. The retry remains as a safety net
#   for residual Apple-XCTest crashes (~10 % per the #3137 thread):
#   each flow is retried up to MAESTRO_MAX_ATTEMPTS times (default 3);
#   a hung JVM is killed after MAESTRO_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_SEC (default 480)
#   when the CLI tee-log or `--debug-output` maestro.log matches the
#   driver hang/death class. `IOSDriverTimeoutException` matches
#   anywhere in the file. ConnectException / `Failed to connect to
#   /127.0.0.1:7001` / `Connection refused` / `Connection reset` /
#   `UnknownFailure` HTTP 500 on `:7001/deviceInfo` only
#   count from the first `Running flow ` line onward (inclusive) —
#   every iOS start logs those strings during the XCTest installer
#   status-check *before* the flow. If `Running flow ` is absent the
#   whole file is searched (driver never came up). Maestro often
#   disguises XCUITest-driver death as a later assertion failure on
#   stdout while the ConnectException lives only in the debug log.
#   A hung JVM after that 500 is killed per attempt
#   (`MAESTRO_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_SEC`) so the job does not sit until
#   GitHub cancels the workflow. Assertion failures without those
#   patterns are NEVER retried — those are real regressions and
#   must surface as red CI checks.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run-handbook-flows.sh                    # run ALL handbook flows
#   scripts/run-handbook-flows.sh 25-restore-wallet  # run only matching flows
#   scripts/run-handbook-flows.sh '2*' 12-settings   # multiple glob patterns
#   scripts/run-handbook-flows.sh --matcher-self-test
#
#   With no arguments every flow in .maestro/handbook/*.yaml runs (the
#   default, full-suite behaviour). With one or more positional arguments,
#   each argument is a bash glob pattern matched against the flow basename
#   (filename without the `.yaml` extension); only flows whose basename
#   matches AT LEAST ONE pattern are run, in the same deterministic sorted
#   order. If arguments are given but match zero flows the script exits 1.
#
# WARNING — handbook flows are a sequential CHAIN sharing app state:
#   The numbered flows are designed to run in order, each one continuing
#   from the app state the previous flow left behind. Running a mid-chain
#   flow in isolation will fail because it expects state set up by the
#   flows before it. Only flows that begin with their own `launchApp`
#   re-establish a known starting point and are therefore safe to run
#   alone — every other flow must be run together with its predecessors.

# close, so the next invocation finds nothing alive and has to
# uninstall/install/start it again from scratch — the Maestro log line
# `Restarting XCTest Runner (uninstalling, installing and starting)` + a
# fresh `xcodebuild test-without-building`. Across 26 flows that one-time
# ~5 min build is effectively paid 26×.
#
# `--reinstall-driver=false` (Maestro 2.0.10 TestCommand option, default
