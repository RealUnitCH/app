#
# Re-capture every handbook screenshot from a running iOS Simulator.
#
# For each flow in .maestro/handbook/*.yaml (alphabetical order):
#   1. run the Maestro flow — navigates to the screen we want to document
#   2. take a screenshot via `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot`
#
# Why not Maestro's built-in `takeScreenshot`?
#   Maestro screenshots go through XCUITest, which renders the view-hierarchy
#   bitmap. Flutter screens that use `BackdropFilter` (e.g. SeedBlurCard on
#   the seed-backup pages) live on a GPU layer outside that bitmap and come
#   out as solid black PNGs. `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot` uses the
#   simulator's compositor and captures the actual final frame.
#
# Required:
#   * iOS Simulator booted with Runner.app installed (`flutter build ios
#     --simulator --debug` then `xcrun simctl install booted ...Runner.app`)
#   * maestro CLI on PATH (or at $HOME/.maestro/bin/maestro)
#
# Locale:
#   The booted simulator's locale is pinned to de_CH because the handbook
#   flows assert on German UI strings (e.g. "Digitale Wallet", "Erstellen
#   Sie Ihre PIN", "Einstellungen"). Local devs running this script will
#   have their simulator locale temporarily overridden; `simctl erase` on
#   the next run brings it back to defaults. CI runners default to en_US
#   without this pin and would fail the first German-string assertion.
#
# Retry strategy:
#   The Maestro version is pinned by `.maestro-version` (read by the
#   workflow's install step). Historically Maestro 2.3.x–2.5.x had
#   intermittent driver-hang AND silent-tap-loss issues on Apple
#   Silicon + iOS 26.x (see mobile-dev-inc/maestro#3137); the pin
#   targets a known-good release. The retry remains as a safety net
#   for residual Apple-XCTest crashes (~10 % per the #3137 thread):
#   each flow is retried up to MAESTRO_MAX_ATTEMPTS times (default 3)
#   when the failure log contains `IOSDriverTimeoutException`.
#   Assertion failures are NEVER retried — those are real regressions
#   and must surface as red CI checks.
#
# Usage:  scripts/run-handbook-flows.sh

# XCUITest-driver reuse across the per-flow `maestro test` invocations.
#
# Each `maestro test` invocation otherwise pays the full XCUITest-runner
# lifecycle: by default Maestro 2.0.10 *uninstalls* the runner on session
# close, so the next invocation finds nothing alive and has to
# uninstall/install/start it again from scratch — the Maestro log line
# `Restarting XCTest Runner (uninstalling, installing and starting)` + a
# fresh `xcodebuild test-without-building`. Across 19 flows that one-time
# ~5 min build is effectively paid 19×.
#
# `--reinstall-driver=false` (Maestro 2.0.10 TestCommand option, default
# `true`) skips the uninstall step both at session start AND at session
# close. So invocation 1 installs+starts the runner and then *leaves it
# running*; invocations 2-19 hit Maestro's `isChannelAlive()` early-return
# (`UI Test runner already running, returning`) and reuse it — no
# reinstall, no rebuild. The first run on a freshly `simctl erase`-d
# device has nothing to uninstall, so passing the flag there is harmless.
#
# Exception: the IOSDriverTimeoutException retry path below reboots the
# simulator, which kills the running runner. After a reboot the next
