/// Query parameters that scope the [AppRoutes.kyc] flow to the context the user
/// entered it from (`RealunitBuy`, `RealunitSell`, …), as the API reported it.
///
/// The context travels in the URL rather than in `extra` because the flow has a
/// second entry: after a background lock the boot ladder re-pushes the captured
/// location by bare path (`BootNavRestore` in `boot_navigation.dart`), which
/// carries no `extra`. Without the query the restored flow rebuilds unscoped,
/// and the API then computes `processStatus` over every globally required step
/// instead of only those the entered flow needs — reporting a user who has
/// finished `Ident` as still in progress for steps that do not gate buying.
///
/// A null or empty [kycContext] means the API attached none; the route is
/// then entered unscoped exactly as before, never with an invented context.
