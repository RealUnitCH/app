# Testing Guide

RealUnit's tests are organised into five tiers (see [#314](https://github.com/RealUnitCH/app/issues/314)). Each tier trades off fidelity for cost; pick the lowest tier that still proves the behaviour you care about.

| Tier | What it exercises | Hardware | CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Pure Dart logic — cubits, services, signers, parsers | None | ✅ `flutter test --coverage` |
| 1 | Cubit / widget + SDK-boundary fake — sign ceremonies via `FakeBitboxCredentials`; HTTP via `MockClient` | None | ✅ `flutter test --coverage` |
| 2 | Real BitBox firmware-simulator over TCP (`bitbox_flutter` TCP transport) | Docker, no device | 🟡 Deferred — Phase 2 of #314 |
| 3 | Maestro YAML flows on an iOS Simulator (handbook capture) · real BitBox02 hardware variant deferred | iPhone simulator (handbook) · iPhone + BitBox02 Nova (hardware) | 🟢 Handbook flows automated · 🟡 hardware variant deferred — Phase 3 of #314 |
| 4 | BLE traffic capture / replay | Capture on hardware, replay anywhere | 🟡 Stretch — Phase 4 of #314 |

## When to pick which tier

                            regressions on top.
```

If you can write a Tier 0 test, do that. Drop down only when a Tier 0 test would have to mock the very thing under test.

## Tier 0 — pure Dart

Test layout mirrors `lib/`. Stack: [`flutter_test`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_test), [`bloc_test`](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc_test), [`mocktail`](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail) (NOT mockito), [`fake_async`](https://pub.dev/packages/fake_async) for time-bound assertions. Versions are pinned in `pubspec.yaml`.

### Where things go under `test/`

| Path | What goes here |
|---|---|
| `test/packages/**` | Pure-Dart services, signers, parsers, exceptions (mirrors `lib/packages/**`) |
| `test/screens/<feature>/cubit(s)/**` and `test/screens/<feature>/bloc/**` | Cubit/Bloc state-transition specs (in the activated surface for line-coverage) |
| `test/screens/<feature>/**/*_page_test.dart` | `testWidgets` view specs (cover the page, not the cubit logic) |
| `test/integration/` | Cross-layer Tier-1 specs using `FakeBitboxCredentials` (e.g. `kyc_sign_flow_test.dart`) |
| `test/helper/` | Shared test infra: [`pump_app.dart`](../test/helper/pump_app.dart), [`fake_bitbox_credentials.dart`](../test/helper/fake_bitbox_credentials.dart), [`responsive_matrix.dart`](../test/helper/responsive_matrix.dart), [`layout_assertions.dart`](../test/helper/layout_assertions.dart), [`responsive_surface_catalog.dart`](../test/helper/responsive_surface_catalog.dart) |
| `test/models/` | DTO / marshalling specs (`asset_test.dart`, `balance_test.dart`, `transaction_test.dart`, …) |
| `test/setup/` | App lifecycle / bootstrap specs (`lifecycle_initializer_test.dart`) |
| `test/styles/` | Currency / language fixtures (`currency_test.dart`, `language_test.dart`) |
| `test/tool/` | Specs for the Dart scripts under `tool/` (`generate_release_info_test.dart`) |
| `test/widgets/` | Shared widget specs that are not bound to one feature screen |

### Cubit / Bloc

Use `blocTest` from `bloc_test`. Mock the services it depends on with `mocktail.Mock`.

```dart
class _MockDfxKycService extends Mock implements DfxKycService {}
class _MockRealUnitRegistrationService extends Mock implements RealUnitRegistrationService {}

blocTest<KycCubit, KycState>(
  'emits KycCompleted when level >= required and gates have passed',
  setUp: () {
    when(() => kycService.getKycStatus())
        .thenAnswer((_) async => _kycStatus(level: KycLevel.level30));
    when(() => kycService.getUser()).thenAnswer((_) async => _user());
    // The cubit re-fetches the server-side registration info after the
    // disclaimer gate and dispatches on its `state` field. Seed
    // `AlreadyRegistered` to fall through to the `processStatus` dispatch
    // below — the same path the production server walks for a returning
    // shareholder.
    when(() => registrationService.getRegistrationInfo()).thenAnswer(
      (_) async => RealUnitRegistrationInfoDto(
        state: RealUnitRegistrationState.alreadyRegistered,
      ),
    );
  },
  build: buildCubit,
  act: (cubit) async {
    cubit.markLegalDisclaimerAccepted();
    await cubit.checkKyc();
  },
  expect: () => [const KycLoading(), const KycCompleted()],
);
```

See `test/screens/kyc/cubits/kyc/kyc_cubit_test.dart` for the full set of state-transition cases.

### Widget

Use the project's [`pumpApp`](../test/helper/pump_app.dart) helper. Mock the cubits the widget reads from (`MockCubit<State>`) — do not exercise the cubit's logic here, that's a separate test.

```dart
class _MockKycEmailStepCubit extends MockCubit<KycEmailStepState>
    implements KycEmailStepCubit {}

testWidgets('shows SnackBar if submitting fails', (tester) async {
  whenListen(
    kycEmailStepCubit,
    Stream.fromIterable([const KycEmailStepFailure('boom')]),
    initialState: const KycEmailStepInitial(),
  );

  await tester.pumpApp(buildSubject(const KycEmailView()));
  await tester.pump();

  expect(find.byType(SnackBar), findsOneWidget);
});
```

See `test/screens/kyc/steps/kyc_email_page_test.dart`.

### Responsive layout / sticky CTAs (required)

**Bug class this gates:** content taller than the sheet/viewport (long locale, large accessibility text, small phone) pushes bottom buttons outside the clip → they paint or look tappable but **receive no hits**. Reproduced on BitBox pairing (`Bestätigen` on iOS).

**Production contract**

1. Sticky-CTA screens/sheets use [`ScrollableActionsLayout`](../lib/widgets/scrollable_actions_layout.dart): **scrollable body + actions outside the scroll view**.
2. Do **not** put a bare `Spacer()` above buttons and hope content fits. `Spacer()` inside the body is also illegal (unbounded main axis → RenderFlex crash); use `centerBody: true` to vertically center content that still fits the viewport.
3. Do **not** rely on a fixed fraction of screen height without scroll inside it.
4. Host must give the layout a **bounded height** (bottom sheet, `Expanded`, or fixed `SizedBox`). Unbounded height throws a `FlutterError` in every build mode — fail-loud, not a silent broken layout.

**Test contract (gates every catalogued surface against this bug class)**

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| [`responsive_matrix.dart`](../test/helper/responsive_matrix.dart) | Standard phones (iPhone SE → Pro Max, Android compact → large) × text scales `0.85…3.0` |
| [`layout_assertions.dart`](../test/helper/layout_assertions.dart) | `expectNoLayoutOverflow`, `expectFullyTappable` (**real** `tester.tap`, not `onPressed?.call()`; `within` is required and the hit-test path is verified against the target's own render objects) |
| [`responsive_surface_catalog.dart`](../test/helper/responsive_surface_catalog.dart) | Living list of surfaces that **must** have a matrix test and a production file that references `ScrollableActionsLayout`; catalog self-test fails if either file is missing or the reference regresses |
| Matrix specs (e.g. `connect_bitbox_responsive_matrix_test.dart`) | Full `kFullResponsiveMatrix` × every button-bearing state |

The catalog is a living list, not a completeness proof: it does not automatically ensure every sticky-CTA surface in the app is registered. Authors must add new sticky-CTA surfaces to the catalog (with a matrix test); that is a review responsibility.

Rules for PRs:

- Any new bottom sheet / page with a bottom primary action **must** use `ScrollableActionsLayout` (or equivalent Expanded + scroll + sticky actions).
- Register the surface in `kResponsiveSurfaceCatalog` and add a matrix test **in the same PR**.
- Interactive widget tests must prefer `tester.tap` / `expectFullyTappable` over calling `onPressed` on the widget.
- Worst-case content: longest locale you ship (`de`), longest dynamic strings (e.g. real channel-hash shape), not golden-friendly short stubs alone.

Reference implementation: `test/screens/hardware_connect_bitbox/connect_bitbox_responsive_matrix_test.dart` (7 devices × 5 text scales × 5 button states + focused regressions). 29 surfaces are catalogued in [`responsive_surface_catalog.dart`](../test/helper/responsive_surface_catalog.dart) (living list — not a completeness proof; see above).

### Service + HTTP

For services that hit the DFX API, swap in `MockClient` from [`http/testing`](https://pub.dev/packages/http) and a `_MockAppStore` that returns it via the `httpClient` getter.

`DFXAuthService`-derived services walk `getAuthToken()` → `loadSignature()` → `getAuthResponse()` on a cold cache. Pre-seed the JWT in `setUp` so existing tests stay focused on wire behaviour:

```dart
setUp(() {
  appStore = _MockAppStore();
  sessionCache = SessionCache(_MockCacheRepository());
  sessionCache.setAuthToken('test-jwt');                       // short-circuit refresh
  when(() => appStore.sessionCache).thenReturn(sessionCache);
  when(() => appStore.apiConfig)
      .thenReturn(const ApiConfig(networkMode: NetworkMode.mainnet));
});
```

See `test/packages/service/dfx/dfx_bank_account_service_test.dart`.

### Country data in tests

Golden tests, and any test that touches country data (`CountryField`, the KYC registration/nationality steps, the settings address form, the `SettingsUserDataCubit`), must **not** stub `DfxCountryService` with a mocktail mock — neither `getAllCountries()` nor `getCountryBySymbol()`. Country data flows through the real `DfxCountryService`, fed from a committed snapshot of the production `GET /v1/country` response (`test/fixtures/dfx_countries.json` — 250 entries, public data, no PII). The only canned seam is the HTTP client: a `MockClient` from [`http/testing`](https://pub.dev/packages/http) serving the fixture. No mocktail stub of `DfxCountryService` remains — the former `getCountryBySymbol` interaction tests (KYC registration prefill, `SettingsUserDataCubit`) now assert on the resolved country instead. `test/packages/service/dfx/dfx_country_service_test.dart` builds the real service directly over its own `MockClient`, which is the same HTTP seam, not a stub of the country data.

The shared helper is [`test/helper/country_fixture.dart`](../test/helper/country_fixture.dart):

- `fixtureCountryService()` — a real service that serves the fixture for `GET /v1/country`. Register it in `getIt` wherever a test needs a populated dropdown.
- `failingCountryService()` — always responds 500, for the field's error branch.
- `countryServiceWithClient(client)` — an escape hatch for bespoke `MockClient` behaviour (a `Completer`-gated response for the loading state, or a fail-then-recover client for the retry path).
- `countriesFixtureResponse()` — a ready-made `200` fixture response, for converted tests that resolve the loading and retry paths with their own `MockClient`.

The fixture holds both KYC-allowed (e.g. Switzerland) and disallowed (e.g. Afghanistan, United States) countries, so purpose filtering (`residence` vs `nationality`) can be asserted against real data. See `test/widgets/form/country_field_test.dart`.

### Mocktail gotchas

- `Future<X>`-returning methods must use `thenAnswer((_) async => …)`, not `thenReturn`.
- For matchers like `any()` over non-nullable custom types, register a fallback in `setUpAll`:

  ```dart
  setUpAll(() => registerFallbackValue(_registrationFixture));
  ```

- Test mocks should be private to the file (`class _MockX extends Mock implements X {}`). Don't leak them across files.

### Constructor-fires-work cubits

Some cubits kick off async work in their constructor (`SellBitboxCubit` calls `scheduleMicrotask(_checkEthBalance)`; `KycCubit` enters `checkKyc` via the page-level `BlocProvider(create: …)`). `blocTest`'s state-sequence assertion attaches a listener *after* the constructor runs, so it can miss the synchronous initial emit.

Wait for the terminal state instead:

```dart
final cubit = build();
final state = await cubit.stream.firstWhere((s) => s is SellBitboxEthReady);
```

This is also the pattern when you want to assert on the *final* state after a chain of internal emits (Loading → RequestingFaucet → WaitingForEth) without listing every transient step.

### Widget tests that overflow the default viewport

The default `tester` viewport is 800×600. Rows with multiple expanded children + long labels (`SellBitboxDepositStep`'s amount row, `LegalDisclaimerStep`'s text columns) report `RenderFlex overflowed by N pixels on the right/bottom`. Bump the viewport in the offending test:

```dart
tester.view.physicalSize = const Size(1200, 2400);
tester.view.devicePixelRatio = 1.0;
addTearDown(tester.view.resetPhysicalSize);
```

Don't change the production widget to compensate — the production layout is fine on real devices.

### GoRouter harness for sheets that call `context.pop`

`pumpApp` (via `MaterialApp.home`) does not provide a GoRouter, so any sheet that calls `context.pop(result)` throws "Null check operator used on a null value" on render. Use the `MaterialApp.router` constructor with a minimal route:

```dart
final router = GoRouter(
  routes: [GoRoute(path: '/', builder: (_, _) => const MyBottomSheet())],
);
addTearDown(router.dispose);
await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp.router(
  routerConfig: router,
  localizationsDelegates: [S.delegate, GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate],
  supportedLocales: S.delegate.supportedLocales,
));
```

`pumpApp` is fine for widgets that don't pop — only switch to the router harness when you need `context.pop` resolvable.

### Shared test private key

`FakeBitboxCredentials` derives its signatures from a single deterministic test private key. Reuse the same key directly when you need a real `EthPrivateKey` credential (for example to drive `Eip7702Signer.signAuthorization`, which rejects `BitboxCredentials`):

```dart
const _testPrivateKeyHex =
    'fb1ace12f9801e85f3db1b3935dd47d9f064f98152466f47c701b5e12680e612';
final privKey = EthPrivateKey.fromHex(_testPrivateKeyHex);
// Derived address: 0x9F5713DEacB8e9CAB6c2d3FaE1AFc2715F8D2D71
```

Sharing the key lets cross-layer tests assert on a single recovered signer address — and means any envelope encoded by `FakeBitboxCredentials(success)` round-trips through `Eip712Signer.signRegistration` to the same byte sequence.

### Service lifecycle (fake_async)

Services with a `Timer`, an observer/subscription loop, or a platform/`MethodChannel` dependency must have a lifecycle test that instantiates the real class — never a mock of the service-under-test. Mocking the service hides timer leaks, unsubscribed listeners, and double-init bugs.

Time-bound assertions must drive time via `package:fake_async`. Wall-clock `Future.delayed` is not acceptable: it makes tests slow and flaky.

```dart
import 'package:bitbox_flutter/bitbox_flutter.dart';
import 'package:bitbox_flutter/testing.dart';
import 'package:bitbox_flutter/usb/bitbox_usb_platform_interface.dart';
import 'package:fake_async/fake_async.dart';

late BitboxUsbPlatform previousPlatform;
late SimulatedBitboxPlatform platform;

setUp(() {
  previousPlatform = BitboxUsbPlatform.instance;
  platform = installSimulatedBitboxPlatform();
});
tearDown(() {
  BitboxUsbPlatform.instance = previousPlatform;
});

// Pairing must run inside the fakeAsync zone so the periodic timer the
// service installs is bound to the fake clock — otherwise `async.elapse`
// will not pump it.
BitboxService pairedServiceSync(FakeAsync async) {
  final service = BitboxService(
    connectionStatusInterval: const Duration(milliseconds: 50),
  );
  late List<BitboxDevice> devices;
  service.getAllUsbDevices().then((d) => devices = d);
  async.flushMicrotasks();
  service.init(devices.single);
  async.flushMicrotasks();
  return service;
}

test('observer releases USB transport when device vanishes', () {
  fakeAsync((async) {
    final service = pairedServiceSync(async); // real instance, not a mock

    platform.when(
      SimulatedBitboxMethod.getDevices,
      (_) async => const <BitboxDevice>[],
    );
    service.startConnectionStatusObserver();
    async.elapse(const Duration(milliseconds: 150));

    expect(
      platform.count(SimulatedBitboxMethod.close),
      greaterThanOrEqualTo(1),
    );
  });
});
```

See `test/packages/hardware_wallet/bitbox_service_test.dart`. The rule is also documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` ("Service-lifecycle tests are mandatory").

### Exception surface

Every typed exception in `lib/` (any class that `implements Exception` or `extends Exception`) must:

1. Override `toString()` so the rendered string is non-empty and does not contain `Instance of '...'`.
2. Be enumerated in `test/packages/service/dfx/exceptions/exception_surface_test.dart` in the same PR that introduces it.

Exceptions surface in logs, Sentry, and user-facing error states — the Dart default `Instance of '...'` is useless for debugging and unfriendly for users. The surface test catches drift the moment a new exception is added without an enumeration entry.

### Platform-coupled code without an integration test

Platform-specific paths (USB transports, BLE lifecycle, secure storage, biometric prompts, deep links) must either ship a Tier 2/3 counterpart that exercises the real plugin (firmware simulator) or the real transport (Maestro on a device/simulator), or carry an inline `// @no-integration-test: <reason>` annotation. Today the simulator/Maestro counterpart is the long-term option but no `integration_test/` harness is wired up yet (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` footnote on the Tier-1 integration-test slot), so in practice the annotation is the documenting form on every new platform-coupled path. The annotation works at file level (as a dartdoc comment) or immediately above the function/method declaration. Grep current annotations with:

```bash
rg "^//\s*@no-integration-test:" lib/
```

As of today there are 0 annotations in `lib/` — the convention is in place but no platform-coupled path has needed it yet (the Tier 1 `test/integration/` specs cover the BitBox boundary via `FakeBitboxCredentials`, and the other platform surfaces above are not yet referenced from `lib/` in a way that would trip the rule). The block of files listed under "Surface that needs infra work" below is the practical near-term target.

Unit tests with mocked platform channels cannot catch real-device regressions (permission prompts, OS-level lifecycle, transport quirks); the annotation makes the absence of an integration test a deliberate, reviewable decision rather than a silent gap.

## Tier 1 — cubit / widget + SDK-boundary fake

Tier 1 reuses the same `flutter_test` runner but swaps in [`FakeBitboxCredentials`](../test/helper/fake_bitbox_credentials.dart) at the BitBox boundary. The fake `is BitboxCredentials`, so every production type guard (e.g. the `BitboxNotConnectedException` check in `RealUnitRegistrationService`) treats it identically to a real device.

`FakeBitboxBehavior` covers the five real-world ceremony outcomes:

| Mode | Behaviour | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | Deterministic EIP-712 / personal-message signature from an embedded test private key | User confirms on device |
| `cancel` | Returns `'0x'` | iOS bridge cancel signal |
| `disconnect` | Throws `BitboxNotConnectedException`; `isConnected == false` | BLE link drop |
| `timeout` | Never resolves; caller imposes its own outer timeout | Device hangs |
| `malformed` | Returns non-hex data | Frame-desync regression (`bitbox_flutter` PR #11) |

```dart
test('cancel mid-sign: fake → Eip712Signer guard → SigningCancelledException', () async {
  final fake = FakeBitboxCredentials(
    behavior: FakeBitboxBehavior.cancel,
    signDelay: Duration.zero,
  );

  await expectLater(
    Eip712Signer.signRegistration(credentials: fake, /* … */),
    throwsA(isA<SigningCancelledException>()),
  );
});
```

See `test/integration/kyc_sign_flow_test.dart` for cross-layer scenarios (happy path, cancel, disconnect, reconnect-and-retry).

For the disconnect-flip-to-success retry pattern, mutate `fake.behavior` between calls:

```dart
fake.behavior = FakeBitboxBehavior.success;
final retrySig = await fake.signTypedDataV4(1, payload);
```

### When to put a Tier 1 test under `test/integration/` vs `test/`

- `test/integration/` — crosses ≥ 2 production layers AND uses the `FakeBitboxCredentials` boundary. Runs headless, no device. A behaviour change in any of the layers should break it.
- `test/` — exercises a single layer with mocked dependencies.

## Tier 2 — firmware simulator (deferred)

The BitBox02 firmware simulator runs as a Docker container, speaks U2F-HID over TCP, and is pre-seeded with a fixed test mnemonic. Same Rust + C code path as the real device for every crypto operation, including the full 13-page EIP-712 sign.

Status: deferred — Phase 2 of #314 has not landed yet. When it does:

```bash
docker compose up bitbox-simulator
flutter run --dart-define=BITBOX_HOST=localhost:15423
flutter test integration_test/ --dart-define=BITBOX_HOST=localhost:15423
```

Does **not** exercise iOS BLE — the simulator is USB-style framing only. Tier 3 stays the only validation for the BLE transport.

## Tier 3 — Maestro flows

YAML flows under `.maestro/` driven by [`maestro`](https://maestro.mobile.dev).

Status: the handbook subset (`.maestro/handbook/*.yaml`) is automated on PRs labelled `tier3:full` and on every push to `develop` — see `.github/workflows/tier3-handbook.yaml`. The workflow resolves and boots an `iPhone 17` device on the highest available iOS 26 runtime; `scripts/run-handbook-flows.sh` then shuts the device down, `simctl erase`s it (Keychain wipes are the only reliable way to start on the welcome flow — see the script for the rationale), pins the simulator locale to `de_CH` so German handbook assertions pass on the `en_US`-default runner, reinstalls the debug `Runner.app`, and replays every flow back-to-back. Pixel-level drift detection for the page renders is **not** Tier 3's job — that is owned by the Visual-Regression golden suite (`flutter test test/goldens`, see [`visual-regression-tests.md`](visual-regression-tests.md)); Tier 3 catches the regressions Goldens cannot see — broken tap-routing, missing navigation, locale/`Intl` problems, iOS-build/install failures. The per-flow diagnostic captures land in `build/handbook-captures/` and are uploaded as the `handbook-captures` artifact for forensic inspection on assertion failure.

The Maestro version is pinned in `.maestro-version` (today `2.0.10`).
Maestro 2.3.x–2.5.x has documented intermittent failures on Apple
Silicon + iOS 26.x — both driver-hang and silent tap-loss — tracked
upstream as [mobile-dev-inc/maestro#3137](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro/issues/3137).
The pinned version is the workaround the upstream issue closed with.
`scripts/run-handbook-flows.sh` retries the residual driver-hang
class up to three times per flow as a safety net, and Tier 3 is
opt-in via the `tier3:full` label rather than a required status
check on `develop` (unlike `Analyze & Test`, `Visual Regression`,
and `Coverage Floor Gate`, which are required — see ruleset `PRs`
/ id `11317379`) until the reliability is proven on the pinned
version over time. The CI-hardening track that landed this guard
was [#487](https://github.com/RealUnitCH/app/issues/487)
(now closed).

The real-hardware variant (BitBox02 Nova) stays deferred — Phase 3 of #314 — and is the entry point for any PR that adds a `bitbox:full` label later.

## Tier 4 — VCR / replay (stretch)

Capture iOS BLE traffic once on hardware, replay it deterministically thereafter. Status: stretch — Phase 4 of #314. Most of its value is covered by Tier 2 + Tier 3 in tandem.

## CI

Every PR runs Tier 0 and Tier 1 via the `RealUnit Build` workflow (`.github/workflows/pull-request.yaml`):

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run tool/generate_localization.dart
flutter pub run build_runner build
flutter analyze
flutter test --coverage
```

The workflow runs four CI jobs:

- **`Analyze & Test`** — the block above, plus a `lcov --extract` step that narrows `coverage/lcov.info` to the activated surface (`lib/packages/**`, `lib/screens/**/cubit(s)/**`, `lib/screens/**/bloc/**`), followed by `lcov --remove '*.g.dart'` to strip generator output (Drift schema mirror) before summarising. The filtered tracefile (`coverage-lcov`) and a one-line summary (`coverage-summary`) are uploaded as artifacts.
- **`Coverage Floor Gate`** — downloads `coverage-summary` and fails the build when scoped line/function coverage drops below the integers committed to `.coverage-floor-lines` and `.coverage-floor-functions`. Required status check on `develop` + `main` (ruleset `PRs` / id `11317379`) alongside `Analyze & Test` and `Visual Regression` — a coverage regression blocks the merge. Ratchet protocol is documented in `README.md`. The same job also runs `scripts/check-coverage-visibility.sh`, which fails the build when an in-scope file produced no coverage at all: a file that no test loads is absent from `lcov.info` and therefore invisible to the scoped %, so the floor number alone cannot catch it. Files with genuinely no coverable lines (interfaces/ports, barrels) are ratcheted in `.coverage-visibility-allowlist`.
- **`Visual Regression`** — validates committed golden baselines on the deterministic self-hosted macOS runner and uploads render diffs on failure.
- **`BitBox quirks audit`** — runs `bitbox-audit` against the diff and inlines its report into the workflow run summary; uploaded as `bitbox-audit-report`.

Staging deduplication lives in the separate `Staging CI Router` workflow (`staging-ci-fallback.yaml`). On each staging push it verifies that an open, non-draft, same-repository `staging → develop` PR already points at the pushed SHA. That PR's `synchronize` run owns the canonical required checks. If the PR is missing, draft, stale, or cannot be queried, the router dispatches `RealUnit Build` on `staging` as a fail-safe. The router has its own concurrency group and never cancels a PR run, so cancelled checks cannot be attached to the current promotion-PR head.

Tier 3 runs separately under `tier3-handbook.yaml` (push to `develop`, manual, or any PR labelled `tier3:full` except PRs targeting `main`). Its only artifact is `handbook-captures`, the per-flow diagnostic recordings — coverage data is owned by `Analyze & Test` instead.

The Tier 0/1 coverage artifacts (`coverage-lcov`, `coverage-summary`) are emitted by the `Analyze & Test` job in `pull-request.yaml` (see [#323](https://github.com/RealUnitCH/app/pull/323)) and consumed by the `Coverage Floor Gate`. The repo holds a [100 % coverage rule](https://github.com/RealUnitCH/app/pull/322) for new code on the activated surface; the committed floor lives in `.coverage-floor-lines` and `.coverage-floor-functions` and is ratcheted upward per PR — drop the threshold only with reviewer sign-off and a written reason (`coverage:lower-floor` label).

## Surface that needs infra work before it can be unit-tested

Some files are deliberately uncovered today because exercising them would change project architecture, not just add a test. Don't waste time stubbing around these without a focused infra PR first:

| Area | Why it's not unit-tested | What it would take |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/screens/*/`-Page widgets that call `getIt<X>()` directly (Dashboard, Receive, Settings sub-pages) | Service locator usage inside `build` makes the cubits the page wires up impossible to swap | Move the `BlocProvider(create: (_) => Cubit(getIt<X>()))` lookup up one layer so tests can `BlocProvider.value` a mock |
| `lib/widgets/chain_asset_icon.dart`, `lib/widgets/image_picker_sheet.dart` | `Image.asset` / `ImagePicker` need a real asset bundle / platform channel | Mock the asset loader / use the platform-interface fake |
| `lib/setup/di.dart` `setupEssentials()` — the SQLCipher encryption-key lifecycle (create-on-first-boot / read-existing / "db present but key missing" guard) | It constructs `const SecureStorage()` inline and calls `AppDatabase.getDatabasePath()` + `SharedPreferences.getInstance()`, wiring everything into the global `getIt`; none of the three is injectable, so a test can neither swap the keystore nor observe the key branch without booting the real locator | Parameterise `setupEssentials` on an injectable `SecureStorage` (it already ships `@visibleForTesting SecureStorage.withStorage`) and a directory port, and reset `getIt` per test. This is an injection-point change to boot code that touches the wallet encryption key, so it wants its own reviewed PR rather than riding along here |

The boot-time security-flag migration next to it is already covered: `lib/setup/di.dart`'s `_migrateSecurityFlags` was promoted to `@visibleForTesting migrateSecurityFlags(prefs, secureStorage)`, and `test/setup/di_test.dart` drives it against `SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues` + `SecureStorage.withStorage(mock)` — covering the biometric / lockout-counter / lock-until migrations, the unparseable-timestamp branch, and the `isPinEnabled` cleanup. Only the encryption-key lifecycle in the row above still needs the injection-point work.

Drift-backed repositories under `lib/packages/repository/*` are fully covered: `AppDatabase.forTesting` (`lib/packages/storage/database.dart`) accepts `NativeDatabase.memory()`, and `test/packages/repository/{asset,balance,cache,transaction,wallet}_repository_test.dart` exercise every wrapper. The SharedPreferences-backed `SettingsRepository` and the service-backed `SupportedFiat`/`SupportedLanguage` repositories have specs alongside them too.

The Sumsub `flutter_idensic_mobile_sdk_plugin` boundary previously listed here is now abstracted via `SumsubIdentPort` (interface under `lib/screens/kyc/steps/ident/cubits/kyc_ident/sumsub_ident_port.dart`, real implementation `SumsubIdentSdkAdapter` outside the cubit folder). The cubit takes the port via constructor injection and is covered by `test/screens/kyc/steps/ident/cubits/kyc_ident/kyc_ident_cubit_test.dart` with an inline `_FakeSumsubIdentPort`. The SDK adapter itself carries the `@no-integration-test` annotation and is intentionally outside the cubit coverage scope.

The `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` / `getTemporaryDirectory()` boundary that used to block `transaction_history_*receipt_cubit` and `settings_tax_report_cubit` is now abstracted via `DocumentsDirectoryPort` (interface under `lib/packages/io/documents_directory_port.dart`, real implementation `PathProviderAdapter`). The cubits take the port via constructor injection with a `const PathProviderAdapter()` default. The adapter forwarders carry a block-level `coverage:ignore` + `@no-integration-test` annotation because they are 1:1 wrappers around the platform channel the port abstracts. The same port is also used by `AppDatabase.getDatabasePath()`.

When you find yourself wanting to test one of these, do the infra PR first and document the new injection point in this file.

## Adding tests when you touch BitBox-related code

PRs touching `KycCubit`, `KycRegistrationSubmitCubit`, `Eip712Signer`, `DFXAuthService`, `BitboxCredentials`, or `bitbox_flutter` must add Tier 0 (and ideally Tier 1) coverage. The pattern that gets BitBox bugs caught early:

1. Identify the new behaviour as either a logic branch (Tier 0) or a multi-layer interaction (Tier 1).
2. If Tier 1: pick the `FakeBitboxBehavior` that exercises it. If none fits, extend the enum.
3. Assert the typed result (`SigningCancelledException`, specific `KycState`, specific `RegistrationStatus`) — never on a stringified message.
